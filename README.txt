System Requirements: Windows XP or higher to run SecroCryptr.exe, C++ IDE to edit .cpp files

This is a user-friendly, math-intensive program aimed at implementing the principles of the Hill Cipher in C++ code. 

Method of Encryption/Decryption:
As stated above, SecroCryptr uses the Hill Cipher, which involves assigning each letter in the alphabet (other characters are
not supported) a numerical value and multiplying the characters in groups of 3 with a 3x3 matrix of randomly generated numbers. 
To fully understand the encryption/decryption method, visit https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_cipher
